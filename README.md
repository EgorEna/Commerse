# Commerce
My second project from CS50
## Commerce  app

This app is something something similar to ebay auctions service.
Whole project is based on "traditional" multi-page way.

**How to use it?**
 - create user
 - watch published listings
 - on detail view you can add a bid and get a chance to win this auctions
 - you can create your own listing and close whenever you want (winner should display on a listing view)
 - search listings by category is available

Here is also some project management in admin app.
